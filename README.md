# TensorFlow - Why and How

**Hi Everyone,**

I was thinking to start this from long time but as usual somethings keeps coming.
This series will be focusing on why you should be aware about TensorFlow platform if you are dealing with Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, AI and looking for one thing which can help you in end to end workflow.

I will start with first story: My experience in ML with TensorFlow and then once 'Why' is clear will start answering 'How'

Note:- This is my personal experience and should not be taken as one is better over other, in your case results might not be the same. 
Also was trying medium platform but they did not allow so thinking to start with Github pages only
