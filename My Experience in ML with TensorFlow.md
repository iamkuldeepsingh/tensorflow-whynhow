## Brief background about me https://www.linkedin.com/in/iamkuldeepsingh ##

**Why I got in contact with TensorFlow**

My journey started with very basic stats work and normal prediction with the IT data itself, when it really helped in making some `data driven decisions` like others I also got interested to explore `Data Science` world, Till I touch the typical `ML` and `DS` workflow things were going quite well with standard libraries such as `numpy, pandas, scikit-learn` and many others, While studying and implementing `Deep Learning` it was becoming tedious task to train, build and put up the layers itself for 25000 Pictures for 22 classes with these libraries.

So, hunt started for good framework in this area and there were two options we were having `PyTorch` and `TensorFlow` when we talked with other experts in this area they mentioned to start with `Keras` and `TensorFlow` as that would be simplest to start building with sequential layers if we are looking to put things into **productions** rather than **experiment** only. Just to mention we earlier thought of prototype to be quicker than we realised it would not be of use. From that day we have not looked back and our hypothesis turned out to be true.


**Difficulties playing with Tensors**

There was a time when we had to start playing with direct `TensorFlow 1.x` code, it was hard way of learning and kind of difficult from `Pythonic` way and we wished there would be changes in latest version.

**Experience with latest changes in 2.x**

Looks like TF Community listened to our and many other voices and came up with this latest version with focus on `simplicity` remember things on scale will work if they are simple in nature, two very important point which resonates with us

- Easy model building and eager execution
- Model deployment option on various platform

**Closing Thoughts**

Although I have started using `TensorFlow 2.x` but still need to migrate from older version to new, I am amazed to see how it has grown from DL library to ML platform and taking of end to end lifecycle including Node.js from browser, Lite for Mobile and IoT TensorFlow Extended, Integration with other platforms.
